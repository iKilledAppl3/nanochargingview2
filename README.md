# NanoChargingView 2 (iOS 10)
This is unfinished and never will be my good friend @antique_dev on Twitter is working with @bellis1000 (oringal NanoChargingView 1.0.x creator) to update it for iOS 10 
This was an attempt to do it myself but I'm busy working on my own tweaks (I collaborated with @bellis1000 with version 1.1-1 on iOS 9) but I am not in the mood to make it :P
